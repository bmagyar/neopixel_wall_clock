# neopixel_wall_clock

This project is about an Arduino-animated wall clock that sits in a regular picture frame. I'm using NeoPixel LEDs for illumination, a photo-resistor for automatic brightness adjustment, a pushbutton+potentiometer to provide controls for setting the time and an Arduino Nano to bring all these things together.
